**Qurridor Game**

This project is an online game of Quoridor, a board game where players try to reach the opposite side of the board while placing walls to block their opponents. The project uses sockets and C++ to create a networked multiplayer game. The project has a game server that handles the game logic and communication, and a game client that displays the game board and the player actions.
